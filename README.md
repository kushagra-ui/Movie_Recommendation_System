# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Movie Recommendation System** is a machine learning–based application designed to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and behavior. Recommendation systems are widely used by platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Spotify to improve user experience by providing personalized content.

This project demonstrates how data science and machine learning techniques can be applied to build a practical and real-world recommendation engine.

## 🎯 Objectives

* To recommend relevant movies to users
* To understand and implement recommendation algorithms
* To analyze user preferences and movie features
* To improve user engagement through personalization

---

## 🧠 Types of Recommendation Systems Used

This project can include one or more of the following approaches:

### 1️⃣ Content-Based Filtering

* Recommends movies similar to the ones a user likes
* Uses movie features such as **genre, cast, director, and keywords**
* Similarity is calculated using **Cosine Similarity** or **TF-IDF Vectorization**

### 2️⃣ Collaborative Filtering

* Recommends movies based on user-user or item-item similarity
* Uses **user ratings** and interaction data
* Works well when sufficient user data is available

### 3️⃣ Hybrid Recommendation System (Optional)

* Combines content-based and collaborative filtering
* Provides more accurate and diverse recommendations
